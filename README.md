A Facebook clone built using Ruby on Rails. It is an application of the MVC pattern and RESTful development principles, with some non-RESTful resources here and there. The technologies used include:
(1) Postgresql for the database
(2) PG Search to take advantage of Postgresql's full-text search feature
(3) DelayedJobActiveRecord as an adapter for ActiveJobs
... and much, much more.
